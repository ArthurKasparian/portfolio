# Personal Website
This is the source code of my personal website, which I'm currently using to showcase my projects and accomplishments, though that is bound to change in the future with inevitable updates!<br/>
The project was build using plain HTML/CSS/JS and a lot of hard work. Please feel free to check the sidebar for more information.
